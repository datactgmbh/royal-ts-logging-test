# Royal TS Logging Test

This small script is just a small helper to test Royal TS V7's Serilog integration.

To run this server, you need a version of python installed on your Windows Machine.

## Configuration

To be able to send the HTTP logs to this (or any other server) you need to configure Royal TS 7 by copy & pasting the content of "royalLogsExampleConf.json" to the Text field in Options > Advanced > Logging > Advanced.

## Disclaimer

You're doing this at your own risk. 

Back up ```%APPDATA%\code4ward\appsettings.json``` before you change anything.
